#Abstract
In the continuously evolving world of programming, the number of aspiring developers is only increasing.
To encourage the pursuit of software engineering, the provision of a smooth shell programming experience for beginners as well as experienced programmers with a user-friendly and efficient terminal shell is essential.
This project aims to design a terminal shell that focuses more on user interface and optimized commands to cater to the needs of a larger group of programmers that donâ€™t want to use the same old bland terminal shells.
