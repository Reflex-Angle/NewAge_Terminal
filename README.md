# Abstract
- In the continuously evolving world of programming, the number of aspiring developers is only increasing.

- To encourage the pursuit of software engineering, the provision of a smooth shell programming experience for beginners as well as experienced programmers with a user-friendly and efficient terminal shell is essential.

- This project aims to design a terminal shell that focuses more on user interface and optimized commands to cater to the needs of a larger group of programmers that don’t want to use the same old bland terminal shells.

# Why this project?

Everyone starts somewhere. But no one wants to start with a black and white command prompt terminal that is difficult to learn with.

When we ourselves were novices in the programming field, we would have certainly preferred to have a clear understanding of how to work around a terminal shell. In fact, even now, who doesn’t want a nicer programming experience?

Starting as only a baseline for the project, we foresee this terminal design having a larger scope with several features to optimize the user experience.
After a few test runs, we will be able to gain more insights and feedback to upgrade the design even further.

# High Level Design

- Window made using tkinter with components from customtkinter.

- Contains a button to run the inputted  commands and a help button to display preprogrammed commands and their descriptions.

- Contains a button to toggle between dark and light mode.

- Terminal View: Main window of the terminal. 

- Command is extracted from the command line and processed to provide an output in the terminal window.

- History View: Previously run commands are stored here using an array

- Help window: Comprehensive documentation explaining each command line function with their respective usages.

- Directory: Contains a sub window to display the current working directory

- Widgets to display dynamic CPU and memory utilisation metrics. Additionally, multithreading is used to provide concurrency

- Scalability: Scope for addition of customisable commands to suit the user’s personal requirements

# What's the point?

### Terminal (command-line) programming seems dry, but it remains highly relevant in the software realm.

- Terminal programs are universally compatible across different operating systems.

- Scripting is done best on terminal shells and this design helps programmers have an amazing experience with it.

### TermEZ is EZ:

- This terminal design greatly improves the comprehensibility of shell programming.

- Learning curve smoothened for beginners and terminal programming is more appealing.

### TermEZ is EZ.2:

- This terminal also appeals to advanced programmers with many more features, metric displays and customizations.

- The elegant design and potential customization just contributes to an overall improvement in user experience.

### Command line familiarity:

- Command-line engineering is a crucial skill and being familiar with necessary commands is invaluable. With the help of easy comprehension and a command helpdesk available in the terminal, it is easy to get familiar.
